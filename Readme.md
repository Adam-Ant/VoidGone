# VoidGone - a minecraft datapack

This datapack teleports players out of the void, and instead gives them a debuff and shames them to the server. Its for servers and players who thnk that falling into the void is not all that fun, and want something a little easier.

## Installation

Download the datapack from [here](https://github.com/Adam-Ant/VoidGone/archive/master.zip), and put it into the datapacks folder in your world. Now either restart the server, or type /reload to load the datapack.

Now in the End, go to where you wish for the player to be teleported to. Bear in mind that fall damage will still be preserved, so putting a pool of water under the players feet is a good idea. When you have the location prepped, run `/function voidgone:init` to start the datapack. Enjoy!

## Moving the marker
If you wish to move the teleport location, simply go to the new location in the end, and type `/function voidgone:move`
